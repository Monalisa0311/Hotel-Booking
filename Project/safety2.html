    <h1>STAY SAFE WITH US</h1>
    <h2>Our hotel ensures the highest standards of cleanliness and sanitation</h2>
    <p>The health and safety of our guests and team members is our number one priority. As such, all our team members have received specific training on COVID-19 protocols, particularly for teams with frequent guest contact including Reception, Housekeeping and Food and Beverage.</p>
    <h3>Early Isolation</h3>
    <p>Our team members are trained and briefed to report all guests presenting COVID-19 symptoms on property. This allows us to take immediate action to assess their medical condition and ensure guests can isolate in their room or be referred to a medical facility for further assessment.</p>
    <h3>Social Distancing</h3>
    <p>Our hotel will ensure all guests and team members are following physical distancing rules, as outlined by government regulations, by standing at least 2 meters away from others throughout all areas of the property.</p>
    <h3>Hand Sanitizers</h3>
    <p>Hand sanitizers are placed throughout the hotel at guest and service entrances as well as high-contact areas such as reception/hotel lobby, restaurant entrances, and elevator landings. Hand sanitizer will also be provided in guest rooms and for the back of house areas.</p>
    <h3>Protective Equipment</h3>
    <p>Appropriate protective equipment is worn by all team members based on their roles and responsibilities and in adherence with government regulations.</p>
    <h3>Disinfection Products</h3>
    <p>We use industry-leading cleaning and sanitizing products that have been approved for use against viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.</p>
    <h3>Air Filter and HVAC Cleaning</h3>
    <p>The frequency of air filter replacement and HVAC system cleaning has been increased and fresh air exchange is optimized.</p>
    <h3>The Guest Journey</h3>
    <p>We are kindly asking guests for their time of arrival to the property, to ensure we are prepared for their arrival.</p>
    <p><span>Rooms</span>are allocated to allow appropriate levels of social distancing with one room vacant in between rooms.</p>
    <p><span>Alternate desks</span>are used for guest registration and check out to ensure social distancing. Your room will be cleaned upon request during your stay. Upon guest departure, all rooms undergo<span> intensive sanitization</span>.</p>
    <p>Guests are asked to use <span>hand sanitizer</span> whenever possible.</p>
    <h3>Hotel elevators:</h3>
    <p>In addition to regular cleaning, the internal and external panels will be sanitized on an ongoing basis. No more than 2 guests are permitted at a time. Avoid elevators whenever possible or elevator up and stairs down.</p>
    <h3>Public areas:</h3>
    <p> The frequency of cleaning has been expanded in all public areas with approved disinfectants including front desk counters, concierge desk, elevators, door handles, public washrooms, handrails, and gym equipment (once permitted to operate).</p>
    <h3>Bar and restaurants:</h3>
    <p>Table plans in the bar and restaurants ensure a two-meter distance between guests as outlined by government regulations. Surfaces, seats, and high contact areas are regularly sanitized.  The breakfast buffet has been discontinued at this time.</p>
